This folder contains the complete version of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) script that will be used in the live coding session on the remote sensing day.
The script in this folder with the name "complete_example_script.js" or can be accessed directly [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/14a7819a333a6bb8ccf5a39aa649e597) if you have already registered for GEE.

# Goal

* brief understanding of how GEE works through live coding hands on

## will cover
1. GEE data types common in geospatial/remote sensing studies
2. example code to illustrate common procedures in optical remote sensing
3. an example extracting lake water color time series over a point of interest

## will not cover
* some other data types
* ui
* non-optical remote sensing
* machine learning

## additional resources for GEE

1. [Official GEE guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides)
2. Materials from past Earth Engine User Submit or Geo For Good meetings, some sessions recordings can be found at Google Earth [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/googleearth/playlists)
3. Subscribe to [GEE announcement google group](https://groups.google.com/g/google-earthengine-announce) for latest workshops and lightning talks
